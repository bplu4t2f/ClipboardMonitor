Displays what's in the clipboard.

 - Text without formatting (`CF_UNICODETEXT`)
 - Images (`CF_DIB`)

Can be set to update automatically, never update, or update just the next time the clipboard changes.

For privacy reasons, it does not automatically read the clipboard contents on program startup (press F5 to update explicitly).
